## About Pinguin warfare

Pinguin warfare is the first full game made in the framework, it is made for my intake assessment at Buas.

## Compiling

Compiling is described on the Centauri page [Here](centauri).
Just make sure that "MAKE_PINGUIN_WARFARE" is turned on in the CMakeLists.txt file(It is by default).
