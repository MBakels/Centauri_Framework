## About Pinguin warfare

Pinguin warfare is the first full game made in the framework, it is made for my intake assessment at Buas.

## Controles

The game is fully controlled by mouse, you move around by pressing the left mouse button in the direction you want to move in 
and you throw a snowball by pressing the right mouse button.

## Compiling

Compiling is described on the Centauri page [Here](../../centauri).
Just make sure that "MAKE_PINGUIN_WARFARE" is turned on in the CMakeLists.txt file(It is by default).
