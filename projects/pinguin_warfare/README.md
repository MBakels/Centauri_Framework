## About Pinguin warfare

Pinguin warfare is the first full game made in the framework, it is made for my intake assessment at Buas.
In the game you control a pinguin, and your goal is to throw snowballs at the other pinguins.
Each pinguin has 5 lives, if all lives are gone the pinguin is out of the game.
To win the game you must take out all other pinguins.

## Controles

The game is fully controlled by mouse, you move around by pressing the left mouse button in the direction you want to move in 
and you throw a snowball by pressing the right mouse button.

## Compiling

Compiling is described on the Centauri page [Here](https://github.com/MBakels/Centauri_Framework).
Just make sure that "MAKE_PINGUIN_WARFARE" is turned on in the CMakeLists.txt file(It is by default).
