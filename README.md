## About tb2d

Centauri framework is a basic 2D framework that is used for making games. It is still a work in progress.

## Compiling

You can use CMake to create the project files.
You can download it here https://cmake.org/
Under windows run this in the PowerShell to generate the project files, the project files will be placed in a folder called `build`.

```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -Wno-dev ..
```

The framework is tested in windows 10 using visual studio 2017. If you are using something else i can't guarantee it will work.
